## How to contribute

If you find what looks like a bug:

* Check the [GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/issues/)
  to see if anyone else has reported issue.
* If you don't see anything, create an issue with information on how to reproduce it.

If you want to contribute an enhancement or a fix:

* Fork the project on GitHub.
* Make a topic branch from the develop branch.
* Make your changes with tests.
* Commit the changes without making changes to any files that aren't related to your enhancement or fix.
* Send a pull request against the develop branch.

Looking for the latest stable release? It's on the
